## Contributing  
Before making any changes, please follow these strict guidelines:

1. **Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).**  
   TL;DR:  
   - Any fix that **does not** break expected behavior is a **patch** (`x.x.+1`).  
   - Any new feature that **does not** break behavior is a **minor** version change (`x.+1.x`).  
   - Any feature/fix that **will break** behavior is a **major** version change (`+1.x.x`).  

2. **Handle breaking changes carefully.**  
   - Avoid breaking changes when possible.  
   - If necessary, **deprecate** a function before removing it.  
   - Introduce a **new function** to replace the deprecated one and update the documentation.  
   - **Only if unavoidable**, modify an existing function directly.

3. **Ensure type definitions are updated.**  
   - All functions must have proper TypeScript type annotations.  
   - If a function is deprecated, update its type definition accordingly.

. **Optimize utility functions.**  
   - If a function is **only a 1-2 line simple operation**, keep it inline.  
   - If it‚Äôs **more than 2 lines and reused multiple times**, move it to `utils/`.
